# Copy Paste

This notebook covers how to load a document object from something you just want to copy and paste. In this case, you don't even need to use a DocumentLoader, but rather can just construct the Document directly.


```python
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
```


```python
text = "..... put the text you copy pasted here......"
```


```python
doc = Document(page_content=text)
```

## Metadata
If you want to add metadata about the where you got this piece of text, you easily can with the metadata key.


```python
metadata = {"source": "internet", "date": "Friday"}
```


```python
doc = Document(page_content=text, metadata=metadata)
```


```python

```
