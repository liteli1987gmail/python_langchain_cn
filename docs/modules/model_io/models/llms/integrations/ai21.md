# AI21

[AI21 Studio](https://docs.ai21.com/) provides API access to `Jurassic-2` large language models.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with [AI21 models](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/jurassic-2-models).


```python
# install the package:
!pip install ai21
```


```python
# get AI21_API_KEY. Use https://studio.ai21.com/account/account

from getpass import getpass

AI21_API_KEY = getpass()
```

     ········
    


```python
from langchain.llms import AI21
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
```


```python
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
```


```python
llm = AI21(ai21_api_key=AI21_API_KEY)
```


```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```


```python
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"

llm_chain.run(question)
```




    '\n1. What year was Justin Bieber born?\nJustin Bieber was born in 1994.\n2. What team won the Super Bowl in 1994?\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl in 1994.'
