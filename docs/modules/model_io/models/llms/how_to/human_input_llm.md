Since we will use the `WikipediaQueryRun` tool in this notebook, you might need to install the `wikipedia` package if you haven't done so already.


```python
%pip install wikipedia

```python
tools = load_tools(["wikipedia"])
llm = HumanInputLLM(
    prompt_func=lambda prompt: print(
        f"\n===PROMPT====\n{prompt}\n=====END OF PROMPT======"

```python
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)
```


```python
agent.run("What is 'Bocchi the Rock!'?")
