# 代理和工具之间的共享内存

这个笔记本介绍了如何给**代理**和**工具**都添加内存。在阅读本笔记本之前，请先阅读以下笔记本，因为本笔记本是基于它们之上的：

- [向 LLM 链添加内存](../../../memory/integrations/adding_memory.html)
- [自定义代理](../../agents/custom_agent.html)

我们将创建一个自定义代理。该代理具有访问对话内存、搜索工具和摘要工具的功能。而且，摘要工具还需要访问对话内存。

```python
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
```

```python
template = """This is a conversation between a human and a bot:

{chat_history}

Write a summary of the conversation for {input}:
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["input", "chat_history"], template=template)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
readonlymemory = ReadOnlySharedMemory(memory=memory)
summry_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    prompt=prompt,
    verbose=True,
    memory=readonlymemory,  # use the read-only memory to prevent the tool from modifying the memory
)
```


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Summary",
        func=summry_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you summarize a conversation. The input to this tool should be a string, representing who will read this summary.",
    ),
]
```


```python
prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools,
    prefix=prefix,
    suffix=suffix,
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history", "agent_scratchpad"],
)
```

We can now construct the LLMChain, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.


```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory
)
```

```python
agent_chain.run(input="What is ChatGPT?")
```

To test the memory of this agent, we can ask a followup question that relies on information in the previous exchange to be answered correctly.
