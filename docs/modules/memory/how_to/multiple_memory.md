# How to use multiple memory classes in the same chain
It is also possible to use multiple memory classes in the same chain. To combine multiple memory classes, we can initialize the `CombinedMemory` class, and then use that.


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import (
    ConversationBufferMemory,
    CombinedMemory,
    ConversationSummaryMemory,
)


conv_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history_lines", input_key="input"
)

summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key="input")
# Combined
memory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory])
_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Summary of conversation:
{history}
Current conversation:
{chat_history_lines}
Human: {input}
AI:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input", "chat_history_lines"],
    template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE,
)
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True, memory=memory, prompt=PROMPT)
```


```python
conversation.run("Hi!")
```

    Prompt after formatting:
