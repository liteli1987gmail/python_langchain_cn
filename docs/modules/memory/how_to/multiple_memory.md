# 如何在同一链条中使用多个记忆类

可以在同一链条中使用多个记忆类。为了组合多个记忆类，我们可以初始化`CombinedMemory`类，然后使用它。


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import (
    ConversationBufferMemory,
    CombinedMemory,
    ConversationSummaryMemory,
)


conv_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history_lines", input_key="input"
)

summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key="input")
# Combined
memory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory])
_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Summary of conversation:
{history}
Current conversation:
{chat_history_lines}
Human: {input}
AI:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input", "chat_history_lines"],
    template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE,
)
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True, memory=memory, prompt=PROMPT)
```


```python
conversation.run("Hi!")
```

    
    
    [1m> Entering new ConversationChain chain...[0m
    Prompt after formatting:
