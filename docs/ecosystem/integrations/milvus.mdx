# Milvus

This page introduces how to use the Milvus ecosystem in LangChain.
It is divided into two parts: installation and setup, and then reference materials for specific Milvus wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install Python SDK using `pip install pymilvus`
## Wrapper

### VectorStore

There is a wrapper around the Milvus index that allows you to use it as a vector store,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vector store:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Milvus
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Milvus wrapper, please see [this notebook](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/milvus.html)
