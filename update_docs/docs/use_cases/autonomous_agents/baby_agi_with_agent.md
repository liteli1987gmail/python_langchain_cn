# BabyAGI with Tools

This notebook builds on top of [baby agi](baby_agi.html), but shows how you can swap out the execution chain. The previous execution chain was just an LLM which made stuff up. By swapping it out with an agent that has access to tools, we can hopefully get real reliable information

## Install and Import Required Modules


```python
import os
from collections import deque
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any

from langchain import LLMChain, OpenAI, PromptTemplate
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import BaseLLM
from langchain.vectorstores.base import VectorStore
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain.chains.base import Chain
from langchain.experimental import BabyAGI
```

## Connect to the Vector Store

Depending on what vectorstore you use, this step may look different.


```python
%pip install faiss-cpu > /dev/null
%pip install google-search-results > /dev/null
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
    


```python
# Define your embedding model
embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Initialize the vectorstore as empty
import faiss

embedding_size = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})
```

## Define the Chains

BabyAGI relies on three LLM chains:
- Task creation chain to select new tasks to add to the list
- Task prioritization chain to re-prioritize tasks
- Execution Chain to execute the tasks


NOTE: in this notebook, the Execution chain will now be an agent.


```python
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChain

todo_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "You are a planner who is an expert at coming up with a todo list for a given objective. Come up with a todo list for this objective: {objective}"
)
todo_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=todo_prompt)
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    ),
    Tool(
        name="TODO",
        func=todo_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to come up with todo lists. Input: an objective to create a todo list for. Output: a todo list for that objective. Please be very clear what the objective is!",
    ),
]


prefix = """You are an AI who performs one task based on the following objective: {objective}. Take into account these previously completed tasks: {context}."""
suffix = """Question: {task}
{agent_scratchpad}"""
prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools,
    prefix=prefix,
    suffix=suffix,
    input_variables=["objective", "task", "context", "agent_scratchpad"],
)
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=tool_names)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True
)
```

### Run the BabyAGI

Now it's time to create the BabyAGI controller and watch it try to accomplish your objective.


```python
OBJECTIVE = "Write a weather report for SF today"
```


```python
# Logging of LLMChains
verbose = False
# If None, will keep on going forever
max_iterations: Optional[int] = 3
baby_agi = BabyAGI.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    task_execution_chain=agent_executor,
    verbose=verbose,
    max_iterations=max_iterations,
)
```


```python
baby_agi({"objective": OBJECTIVE})
```
