>[GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/) is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge bases and APIs.

This notebook shows how to pull page data from any `GitBook`.

```

### Load from all paths in a given GitBook
For this to work, the GitbookLoader needs to be initialized with the root path (`https://docs.gitbook.com` in this example) and have `load_all_paths` set to `True`.


```python
loader = GitbookLoader("https://docs.gitbook.com", load_all_paths=True)
all_pages_data = loader.load()
```
