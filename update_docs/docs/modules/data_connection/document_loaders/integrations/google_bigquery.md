# Google BigQuery

>[Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is a serverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse that works across clouds and scales with your data.
`BigQuery` is a part of the `Google Cloud Platform`.

Load a `BigQuery` query with one document per row.


```python
#!pip install google-cloud-bigquery
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import BigQueryLoader
```


```python
BASE_QUERY = """
SELECT
  id,
  dna_sequence,
  organism
FROM (
  SELECT
    ARRAY (
    SELECT
      AS STRUCT 1 AS id, "ATTCGA" AS dna_sequence, "Lokiarchaeum sp. (strain GC14_75)." AS organism
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      AS STRUCT 2 AS id, "AGGCGA" AS dna_sequence, "Heimdallarchaeota archaeon (strain LC_2)." AS organism
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      AS STRUCT 3 AS id, "TCCGGA" AS dna_sequence, "Acidianus hospitalis (strain W1)." AS organism) AS new_array),
  UNNEST(new_array)
"""
```

## Basic Usage


```python
loader = BigQueryLoader(BASE_QUERY)

data = loader.load()
```


```python
print(data)
```

    [Document(page_content='id: 1\ndna_sequence: ATTCGA\norganism: Lokiarchaeum sp. (strain GC14_75).', lookup_str='', metadata={}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='id: 2\ndna_sequence: AGGCGA\norganism: Heimdallarchaeota archaeon (strain LC_2).', lookup_str='', metadata={}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='id: 3\ndna_sequence: TCCGGA\norganism: Acidianus hospitalis (strain W1).', lookup_str='', metadata={}, lookup_index=0)]
    

## Specifying Which Columns are Content vs Metadata


```python
loader = BigQueryLoader(
    BASE_QUERY,
    page_content_columns=["dna_sequence", "organism"],
    metadata_columns=["id"],
)

data = loader.load()
```


```python
print(data)
```

    [Document(page_content='dna_sequence: ATTCGA\norganism: Lokiarchaeum sp. (strain GC14_75).', lookup_str='', metadata={'id': 1}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='dna_sequence: AGGCGA\norganism: Heimdallarchaeota archaeon (strain LC_2).', lookup_str='', metadata={'id': 2}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='dna_sequence: TCCGGA\norganism: Acidianus hospitalis (strain W1).', lookup_str='', metadata={'id': 3}, lookup_index=0)]
    

## Adding Source to Metadata


```python
# Note that the `id` column is being returned twice, with one instance aliased as `source`
ALIASED_QUERY = """
SELECT
  id,
  dna_sequence,
  organism,
  id as source
FROM (
  SELECT
    ARRAY (
    SELECT
      AS STRUCT 1 AS id, "ATTCGA" AS dna_sequence, "Lokiarchaeum sp. (strain GC14_75)." AS organism
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      AS STRUCT 2 AS id, "AGGCGA" AS dna_sequence, "Heimdallarchaeota archaeon (strain LC_2)." AS organism
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
      AS STRUCT 3 AS id, "TCCGGA" AS dna_sequence, "Acidianus hospitalis (strain W1)." AS organism) AS new_array),
  UNNEST(new_array)
"""
```


```python
loader = BigQueryLoader(ALIASED_QUERY, metadata_columns=["source"])

data = loader.load()
```


```python
print(data)
```

    [Document(page_content='id: 1\ndna_sequence: ATTCGA\norganism: Lokiarchaeum sp. (strain GC14_75).\nsource: 1', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 1}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='id: 2\ndna_sequence: AGGCGA\norganism: Heimdallarchaeota archaeon (strain LC_2).\nsource: 2', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 2}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='id: 3\ndna_sequence: TCCGGA\norganism: Acidianus hospitalis (strain W1).\nsource: 3', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 3}, lookup_index=0)]
