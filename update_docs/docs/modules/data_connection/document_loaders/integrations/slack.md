# Slack

>[Slack](https://slack.com/) is an instant messaging program.

This notebook covers how to load documents from a Zipfile generated from a `Slack` export.

In order to get this `Slack` export, follow these instructions:

## ðŸ§‘ Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

Export your Slack data. You can do this by going to your Workspace Management page and clicking the Import/Export option ({your_slack_domain}.slack.com/services/export). Then, choose the right date range and click `Start export`. Slack will send you an email and a DM when the export is ready.

The download will produce a `.zip` file in your Downloads folder (or wherever your downloads can be found, depending on your OS configuration).

Copy the path to the `.zip` file, and assign it as `LOCAL_ZIPFILE` below.


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import SlackDirectoryLoader
```


```python
# Optionally set your Slack URL. This will give you proper URLs in the docs sources.
SLACK_WORKSPACE_URL = "https://xxx.slack.com"
LOCAL_ZIPFILE = ""  # Paste the local paty to your Slack zip file here.

loader = SlackDirectoryLoader(LOCAL_ZIPFILE, SLACK_WORKSPACE_URL)
```


```python
docs = loader.load()
docs
```
