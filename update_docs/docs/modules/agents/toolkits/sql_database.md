# SQL Database Agent

This notebook showcases an agent designed to interact with a sql databases. The agent builds off of [SQLDatabaseChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/sqlite.html) and is designed to answer more general questions about a database, as well as recover from errors.

Note that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that the agent won't perform DML statements on your database given certain questions. Be careful running it on sensitive data!

This uses the example Chinook database. To set it up follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the .db file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository.

## Initialization


```python
from langchain.agents import create_sql_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase
from langchain.llms.openai import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db")
toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))
```

## Using ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION

This shows how to initialize the agent using the ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent type. Note that this is an alternative to the above.


```python
agent_executor = create_sql_agent(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    toolkit=toolkit,
    verbose=True,
    agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
)
```

## Using OpenAI Functions

This shows how to initialize the agent using the OPENAI_FUNCTIONS agent type. Note that this is an alternative to the above.


```python
# agent_executor = create_sql_agent(
#     llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"),
#     toolkit=toolkit,
#     verbose=True,
#     agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS
# )
```

## Example: describing a table


```python
agent_executor.run("Describe the playlisttrack table")
```

## Example: describing a table, recovering from an error

In this example, the agent tries to search for a table that doesn't exist, but finds the next best result


```python
