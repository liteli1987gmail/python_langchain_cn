# Async API

LangChain provides async support for Agents by leveraging the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library.

Async methods are currently supported for the following `Tools`: [`GoogleSerperAPIWrapper`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/utilities/google_serper.py), [`SerpAPIWrapper`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/serpapi.py) and [`LLMMathChain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py). Async support for other agent tools are on the roadmap.

For `Tool`s that have a `coroutine` implemented (the three mentioned above), the `AgentExecutor` will `await` them directly. Otherwise, the `AgentExecutor` will call the `Tool`'s `func` via `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor` to avoid blocking the main runloop.

You can use `arun` to call an `AgentExecutor` asynchronously.

## Serial vs. Concurrent Execution

In this example, we kick off agents to answer some questions serially vs. concurrently. You can see that concurrent execution significantly speeds this up.
