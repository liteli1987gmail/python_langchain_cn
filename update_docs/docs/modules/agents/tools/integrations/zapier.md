# Zapier Natural Language Actions API
\
Full docs here: https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs

**Zapier Natural Language Actions** gives you access to the 5k+ apps, 20k+ actions on Zapier's platform through a natural language API interface.

NLA supports apps like Gmail, Salesforce, Trello, Slack, Asana, HubSpot, Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, and thousands more apps: https://zapier.com/apps

Zapier NLA handles ALL the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output for LLMs. The key idea is you, or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API.

NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.

1. Server-side (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where LangChain will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)

2. User-facing (Oauth): for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing application and LangChain needs access to end-user's exposed actions and connected accounts on Zapier.com

This quick start will focus on the server-side use case for brevity. Review [full docs](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/docs) or reach out to nla@zapier.com for user-facing oauth developer support.

This example goes over how to use the Zapier integration with a `SimpleSequentialChain`, then an `Agent`.
In code, below:


```python
import os

# get from https://platform.openai.com/
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "")

# get from https://nla.zapier.com/demo/provider/debug (under User Information, after logging in):
os.environ["ZAPIER_NLA_API_KEY"] = os.environ.get("ZAPIER_NLA_API_KEY", "")
```

## Example with Agent
Zapier tools can be used with an agent. See the example below.


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import ZapierToolkit
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.utilities.zapier import ZapierNLAWrapper
```


```python
## step 0. expose gmail 'find email' and slack 'send channel message' actions

# first go here, log in, expose (enable) the two actions: https://nla.zapier.com/demo/start -- for this example, can leave all fields "Have AI guess"
# in an oauth scenario, you'd get your own <provider> id (instead of 'demo') which you route your users through first
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
zapier = ZapierNLAWrapper()
toolkit = ZapierToolkit.from_zapier_nla_wrapper(zapier)
agent = initialize_agent(
    toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)
```


```python
agent.run(
    "Summarize the last email I received regarding Silicon Valley Bank. Send the summary to the #test-zapier channel in slack."
)
```

# Example with SimpleSequentialChain
If you need more explicit control, use a chain, like below.


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, TransformChain, SimpleSequentialChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.tools.zapier.tool import ZapierNLARunAction
from langchain.utilities.zapier import ZapierNLAWrapper
```


```python
## step 0. expose gmail 'find email' and slack 'send direct message' actions

# first go here, log in, expose (enable) the two actions: https://nla.zapier.com/demo/start -- for this example, can leave all fields "Have AI guess"
# in an oauth scenario, you'd get your own <provider> id (instead of 'demo') which you route your users through first

actions = ZapierNLAWrapper().list()
```


```python
## step 1. gmail find email

GMAIL_SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS = "Grab the latest email from Silicon Valley Bank"


def nla_gmail(inputs):
    action = next(
        (a for a in actions if a["description"].startswith("Gmail: Find Email")), None
    )
    return {
        "email_data": ZapierNLARunAction(
            action_id=action["id"],

            params_schema=action["params"],
        ).run(inputs["instructions"])
    }


gmail_chain = TransformChain(
    input_variables=["instructions"],
    output_variables=["email_data"],
    transform=nla_gmail,
)
```


```python
## step 2. generate draft reply

template = """You are an assisstant who drafts replies to an incoming email. Output draft reply in plain text (not JSON).

Incoming email:
{email_data}

Draft email reply:"""

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["email_data"], template=template)
reply_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0.7), prompt=prompt_template)
```


```python
## step 3. send draft reply via a slack direct message

SLACK_HANDLE = "@Ankush Gola"


def nla_slack(inputs):
    action = next(
        (
            a
            for a in actions

```


```python
## finally, execute

overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(
    chains=[gmail_chain, reply_chain, slack_chain], verbose=True
