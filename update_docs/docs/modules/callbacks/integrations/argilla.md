>[Argilla](https://argilla.io/) is an open-source data curation platform for LLMs.
> Using Argilla, everyone can build robust language models through faster data curation 
> using both human and machine feedback. We provide support for each step in the MLOps cycle, 
> from data labeling to model monitoring.

In this guide we will demonstrate how to track the inputs and reponses of your LLM to generate a dataset in Argilla, using the `ArgillaCallbackHandler`.

It's useful to keep track of the inputs and outputs of your LLMs to generate datasets for future fine-tuning. This is especially useful when you're using a LLM to generate data for a specific task, such as question answering, summarization, or translation.

## Installation and Setup


```python
!pip install argilla --upgrade
!pip install openai
```

### Getting API Credentials

To get the Argilla API credentials, follow the next steps:

1. Go to your Argilla UI.
2. Click on your profile picture and go to "My settings".
3. Then copy the API Key.

In Argilla the API URL will be the same as the URL of your Argilla UI.

To get the OpenAI API credentials, please visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys


```python
import os

os.environ["ARGILLA_API_URL"] = "..."
os.environ["ARGILLA_API_KEY"] = "..."

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
```

### Setup Argilla

To use the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` we will need to create a new `FeedbackDataset` in Argilla to keep track of your LLM experiments. To do so, please use the following code:


```python
import argilla as rg
```


```python
from packaging.version import parse as parse_version

if parse_version(rg.__version__) < parse_version("1.8.0"):
    raise RuntimeError(
        "`FeedbackDataset` is only available in Argilla v1.8.0 or higher, please "
        "upgrade `argilla` as `pip install argilla --upgrade`."
    )
```


```python
dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset(
    fields=[
        rg.TextField(name="prompt"),
        rg.TextField(name="response"),
    ],
    questions=[
        rg.RatingQuestion(
            name="response-rating",
            description="How would you rate the quality of the response?",
            values=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            required=True,
        ),
        rg.TextQuestion(
            name="response-feedback",
            description="What feedback do you have for the response?",
            required=False,
        ),
    ],
    guidelines="You're asked to rate the quality of the response and provide feedback.",
)

rg.init(
    api_url=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_URL"],
    api_key=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_KEY"],
)

dataset.push_to_argilla("langchain-dataset")
```

> ðŸ“Œ NOTE: at the moment, just the prompt-response pairs are supported as `FeedbackDataset.fields`, so the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` will just track the prompt i.e. the LLM input, and the response i.e. the LLM output.

## Tracking

To use the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` you can either use the following code, or just reproduce one of the examples presented in the following sections.


```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_URL"],
    api_key=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_KEY"],
)
```

### Scenario 1: Tracking an LLM

First, let's just run a single LLM a few times and capture the resulting prompt-response pairs in Argilla.


```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_URL"],
    api_key=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_KEY"],
)
callbacks = [StdOutCallbackHandler(), argilla_callback]

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=callbacks)
llm.generate(["Tell me a joke", "Tell me a poem"] * 3)
```




    LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='\n\nQ: What did the fish say when he hit the wall? \nA: Dam.', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text='\n\nThe Moon \n\nThe moon is high in the midnight sky,\nSparkling like a star above.\nThe night so peaceful, so serene,\nFilling up the air with love.\n\nEver changing and renewing,\nA never-ending light of grace.\nThe moon remains a constant view,\nA reminder of lifeâ€™s gentle pace.\n\nThrough time and space it guides us on,\nA never-fading beacon of hope.\nThe moon shines down on us all,\nAs it continues to rise and elope.', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text='\n\nQ. What did one magnet say to the other magnet?\nA. "I find you very attractive!"', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text="\n\nThe world is charged with the grandeur of God.\nIt will flame out, like shining from shook foil;\nIt gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil\nCrushed.

### Scenario 2: Tracking an LLM in a chain

Then we can create a chain using a prompt template, and then track the initial prompt and the final response in Argilla.


```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_URL"],
    api_key=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_KEY"],
)
callbacks = [StdOutCallbackHandler(), argilla_callback]
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=callbacks)

template = """You are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.
Title: {title}
Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["title"], template=template)
synopsis_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, callbacks=callbacks)

test_prompts = [{"title": "Documentary about Bigfoot in Paris"}]
synopsis_chain.apply(test_prompts)
```

    
    
    [1m> Entering new LLMChain chain...[0m
    Prompt after formatting:
    [32;1m[1;3mYou are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.
    Title: Documentary about Bigfoot in Paris
    Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:[0m
    
    [1m> Finished chain.[0m
    




    [{'text': "\n\nDocumentary about Bigfoot in Paris focuses on the story of a documentary filmmaker and their search for evidence of the legendary Bigfoot creature in the city of Paris. The play follows the filmmaker as they explore the city, meeting people from all walks of life who have had encounters with the mysterious creature. Through their conversations, the filmmaker unravels the story of Bigfoot and finds out the truth about the creature's presence in Paris. As the story progresses, the filmmaker learns more and more about the mysterious creature, as well as the different perspectives of the people living in the city, and what they think of the creature. In the end, the filmmaker's findings lead them to some surprising and heartwarming conclusions about the creature's existence and the importance it holds in the lives of the people in Paris."}]

### Scenario 3: Using an Agent with Tools

Finally, as a more advanced workflow, you can create an agent that uses some tools. So that `ArgillaCallbackHandler` will keep track of the input and the output, but not about the intermediate steps/thoughts, so that given a prompt we log the original prompt and the final response to that given prompt.

> Note that for this scenario we'll be using Google Search API (Serp API) so you will need to both install `google-search-results` as `pip install google-search-results`, and to set the Serp API Key as `os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = "..."` (you can find it at https://serpapi.com/dashboard), otherwise the example below won't work.


```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_URL"],
    api_key=os.environ["ARGILLA_API_KEY"],
)
callbacks = [StdOutCallbackHandler(), argilla_callback]
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=callbacks)

tools = load_tools(["serpapi"], llm=llm, callbacks=callbacks)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    callbacks=callbacks,
)
agent.run("Who was the first president of the United States of America?")
```

    
    
    [1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
    [32;1m[1;3m I need to answer a historical question

    Final Answer: George Washington was the first president of the United States of America.[0m
    
    [1m> Finished chain.[0m
    




    'George Washington was the first president of the United States of America.'
