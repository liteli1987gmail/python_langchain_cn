# Zep Memory

## REACT Agent Chat Message History with Zep - A long-term memory store for LLM applications.

This notebook demonstrates how to use the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://docs.getzep.com/) as memory for your chatbot.

We'll demonstrate:

1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
2. Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.
3. Viewing the enriched messages.
4. Vector search over the conversation history.

### More on Zep:

Zep stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.

Key Features:

- **Fast!** Zepâ€™s async extractors operate independently of the your chat loop, ensuring a snappy user experience.
- **Long-term memory persistence**, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.
- **Auto-summarization** of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.
- **Hybrid search** over memories and metadata, with messages automatically embedded on creation.
- **Entity Extractor** that automatically extracts named entities from messages and stores them in the message metadata.
- **Auto-token counting** of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.
- Python and JavaScript SDKs.

```python
from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import ZepChatMessageHistory
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from uuid import uuid4


# Set this to your Zep server URL
ZEP_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

session_id = str(uuid4())  # This is a unique identifier for the user
```


```python
# Load your OpenAI key from a .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```




    True



### Initialize the Zep Chat Message History Class and initialize the Agent



```python
ddg = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
tools = [ddg]

# Set up Zep Chat History
zep_chat_history = ZepChatMessageHistory(
    session_id=session_id,
    url=ZEP_API_URL,
)

# Use a standard ConversationBufferMemory to encapsulate the Zep chat history
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history", chat_memory=zep_chat_history
)

# Initialize the agent
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
    memory=memory,
)
```

### Add some history data



```python
# Preload some messages into the memory. The default message window is 12 messages. We want to push beyond this to demonstrate auto-summarization.
test_history = [
    {"role": "human", "content": "Who was Octavia Butler?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Octavia Estelle Butler (June 22, 1947 â€“ February 24, 2006) was an American"
            " science fiction author."
        ),
    },
    {"role": "human", "content": "Which books of hers were made into movies?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "The most well-known adaptation of Octavia Butler's work is the FX series"
            " Kindred, based on her novel of the same name."
        ),
    },
    {"role": "human", "content": "Who were her contemporaries?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Octavia Butler's contemporaries included Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R."
            " Delany, and Joanna Russ."
        ),
    },
    {"role": "human", "content": "What awards did she win?"},
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Octavia Butler won the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, and the MacArthur"
            " Fellowship."
        ),
    },
    {
        "role": "human",
        "content": "Which other women sci-fi writers might I want to read?",
    },
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": "You might want to read Ursula K. Le Guin or Joanna Russ.",
    },
    {
        "role": "human",
        "content": (
            "Write a short synopsis of Butler's book, Parable of the Sower. What is it"
            " about?"
        ),
    },
    {
        "role": "ai",
        "content": (
            "Parable of the Sower is a science fiction novel by Octavia Butler,"
            " published in 1993. It follows the story of Lauren Olamina, a young woman"
            " living in a dystopian future where society has collapsed due to"
            " environmental disasters, poverty, and violence."
        ),
    },
]

for msg in test_history:
    zep_chat_history.append(
        HumanMessage(content=msg["content"])
        if msg["role"] == "human"
        else AIMessage(content=msg["content"])
    )
```

### Run the agent

Doing so will automatically add the input and response to the Zep memory.



```python
agent_chain.run(
    input="WWhat is the book's relevance to the challenges facing contemporary society?"
)
```

    'Parable of the Sower is a prescient novel that speaks to the challenges facing contemporary society, such as climate change, economic inequality, and the rise of authoritarianism. It is a cautionary tale that warns of the dangers of ignoring these issues and the importance of taking action to address them.'



### Inspect the Zep memory

Note the summary, and that the history has been enriched with token counts, UUIDs, and timestamps.

Summaries are biased towards the most recent messages.



```python
def print_messages(messages):
    for m in messages:
        print(m.to_dict())


print(zep_chat_history.zep_summary)
print("\n")
print_messages(zep_chat_history.zep_messages)
```

    The conversation is about Octavia Butler. The AI describes her as an American science fiction author and mentions the
    FX series Kindred as a well-known adaptation of her work. The human then asks about her contemporaries, and the AI lists 
    Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R. Delany, and Joanna Russ.

### Vector search over the Zep memory

Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory. Embedding happens automatically.



```python
search_results = zep_chat_history.search("who are some famous women sci-fi authors?")
for r in search_results:
    print(r.message, r.dist)
```
