### 用例

在本教程中，我们将为自问自答与搜索配置少量示例。
<!-- 警告：此文件是自动生成的！请勿编辑！而是编辑带有此文件位置和名称的笔记本。 -->

## 使用示例集

### 创建示例集

首先，创建一个少量示例的列表。每个示例应该是一个字典，其中键是输入变量，值是这些输入变量的值。

```python
from langchain.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

examples = [
  {
    "question": "Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?",
    "answer": 
"""
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
"""
  },
  {
    "question": "When was the founder of craigslist born?",
    "answer": 
"""
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
"""
  },
  {
    "question": "Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?",
    "answer":
"""
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
"""
  },
  {
    "question": "Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?",
    "answer":
"""
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
Intermediate Answer: The United States.
Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
So the final answer is: No
"""
  }
]
```

### 创建少量示例的格式化程序

配置一个将少量示例格式化为字符串的格式化程序。该格式化程序应该是一个 `PromptTemplate` 对象。


```python
example_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["question", "answer"], template="Question: {question}\n{answer}")

print(example_prompt.format(**examples[0]))
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
    Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
    So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
    
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

### 将示例和格式化程序提供给 `FewShotPromptTemplate`

最后，创建一个 `FewShotPromptTemplate` 对象。该对象接受少量示例和少量示例的格式化程序。


```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples, 
    example_prompt=example_prompt, 
    suffix="Question: {input}", 
    input_variables=["input"]
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
    Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
    So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
    
    
    Question: When was the founder of craigslist born?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
    Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
    Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
    Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
    So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
    
    
    Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
    
    
    Question: Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
    Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
    Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
    Intermediate Answer: The United States.
    Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
    Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
    Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
    Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
    So the final answer is: No
    
    
    Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?

## 使用示例选择器

### 将示例提供给 `ExampleSelector`

我们将重用前一节中的示例集和格式化程序。但是，我们不会直接将示例提供给 `FewShotPromptTemplate` 对象，而是将它们提供给一个 `ExampleSelector` 对象。


在本教程中，我们将使用 `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` 类。该类根据输入与少量示例的相似性选择少量示例。它使用嵌入模型计算输入与少量示例之间的相似性，以及向量存储执行最近邻搜索。


```python
from langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings


example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
    # This is the list of examples available to select from.
    examples,
    # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
    OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
    Chroma,
    # This is the number of examples to produce.
    k=1
)

# Select the most similar example to the input.
question = "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"
selected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({"question": question})
print(f"Examples most similar to the input: {question}")
for example in selected_examples:
    print("\n")
    for k, v in example.items():
        print(f"{k}: {v}")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
    Examples most similar to the input: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    
    
    question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
    answer: 
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
    
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

### 将示例选择器提供给 `FewShotPromptTemplate`

最后，创建一个 `FewShotPromptTemplate` 对象。该对象接受示例选择器和少量示例的格式化程序。


```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector, 
    example_prompt=example_prompt, 
    suffix="Question: {input}", 
    input_variables=["input"]
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
    
    
    Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
```
