```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

我们还可以将历史记录以消息列表的形式获取（如果您将其与聊天模型一起使用，这会很有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## 在链式结构中使用
让我们通过一个示例进行演示，再次设置`verbose=True`以便查看提示信息。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), 
    # We set a low k=2, to only keep the last 2 interactions in memory
    memory=ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2), 
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
