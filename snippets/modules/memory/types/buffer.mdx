```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```


```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```


```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

我们还可以将历史记录作为消息列表获取（当与聊天模型一起使用时，这会很有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## 在链式结构中使用
最后，让我们看一下在链式结构中如何使用（设置`verbose=True`以便查看提示信息）。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    verbose=True, 
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```


```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:
    
    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
conversation.predict(input="I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:  Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?

    AI:
    
    > Finished chain.





    " That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:

    " Sure! I'm an AI created to help people with their everyday tasks. I'm programmed to understand natural language and provide helpful information. I'm also constantly learning and updating my knowledge base so I can provide more accurate and helpful answers."
