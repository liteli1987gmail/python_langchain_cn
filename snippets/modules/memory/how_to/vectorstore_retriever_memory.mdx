```python
from datetime import datetime
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.memory import VectorStoreRetrieverMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

### 初始化你的 VectorStore

根据你选择的存储方式，这一步可能会有所不同。请参考相关的 VectorStore 文档以获取更多详细信息。


```python
import faiss

from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS


embedding_size = 1536 # Dimensions of the OpenAIEmbeddings
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
embedding_fn = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query
vectorstore = FAISS(embedding_fn, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})
```

### 创建你的 VectorStoreRetrieverMemory

内存对象是从任意 VectorStoreRetriever 实例化的。


```python
# In actual usage, you would set `k` to be a higher value, but we use k=1 to show that
# the vector lookup still returns the semantically relevant information
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs=dict(k=1))
memory = VectorStoreRetrieverMemory(retriever=retriever)

# When added to an agent, the memory object can save pertinent information from conversations or used tools
memory.save_context({"input": "My favorite food is pizza"}, {"output": "thats good to know"})
memory.save_context({"input": "My favorite sport is soccer"}, {"output": "..."})
memory.save_context({"input": "I don't the Celtics"}, {"output": "ok"}) #
```


```python
# Notice the first result returned is the memory pertaining to tax help, which the language model deems more semantically relevant
# to a 1099 than the other documents, despite them both containing numbers.
print(memory.load_memory_variables({"prompt": "what sport should i watch?"})["history"])
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    input: My favorite sport is soccer
    output: ...
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## 在链中使用
让我们通过一个例子来演示，再次设置 `verbose=True` 以便我们可以看到提示信息。


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Can be any valid LLM
_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Relevant pieces of previous conversation:
{history}

(You do not need to use these pieces of information if not relevant)

Current conversation:
Human: {input}
AI:"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input"], template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE
)
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    prompt=PROMPT,
    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.
