```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
```

加载文档。您可以将其替换为任何类型数据的加载器


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader("../../state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
```

如果您有多个要合并的加载器，可以这样做：


```python
# loaders = [....]
# docs = []
# for loader in loaders:
#     docs.extend(loader.load())
```

We now split the documents, create embeddings for them, and put them in a vectorstore. This allows us to do semantic search over them.


```python
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

    Using embedded DuckDB without persistence: data will be transient
```

现在我们可以创建一个内存对象，这对于跟踪输入/输出并进行对话是必要的。


```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
```

We now initialize the `ConversationalRetrievalChain`


```python
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"question": query})
```


```python
result["answer"]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."
```

</CodeOutputBlock>


```python
query = "Did he mention who she suceeded"
result = qa({"question": query})
```


```python
result['answer']
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court.'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## 传入聊天历史

在上面的示例中，我们使用了一个内存对象来跟踪聊天历史。我们也可以直接将其传递进去。为了做到这一点，我们需要初始化一个没有任何内存对象的链。


```python
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever())
```

以下是没有聊天历史的问题示例


```python
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
result["answer"]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

Here's an example of asking a question with some chat history


```python
chat_history = [(query, result["answer"])]
query = "Did he mention who she suceeded"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
result['answer']
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    ' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court.'
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## 使用不同的模型来压缩问题

该链有两个步骤。首先，它将当前问题和聊天历史压缩为一个独立的问题。这是创建用于检索的独立向量的必要步骤。之后，它进行检索，然后使用单独的模型进行检索增强生成来回答问题。LangChain声明性的特性之一是您可以轻松为每个调用使用单独的语言模型。这对于在简化问题的较简单任务中使用更便宜和更快的模型，然后在回答问题时使用更昂贵的模型非常有用。下面是一个示例。


```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),
    vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    condense_question_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model='gpt-3.5-turbo'),
)
```


```python
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
chat_history = [(query, result["answer"])]
query = "Did he mention who she suceeded"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```

## 返回源文档

您还可以轻松地从 ConversationalRetrievalChain 返回源文档。这在您想要检查返回了哪些文档时非常有用。


```python
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)
```


```python
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
result['source_documents'][0]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```

## ConversationalRetrievalChain 与 `search_distance`

如果您正在使用支持按搜索距离进行过滤的向量存储，可以添加阈值参数。


```python
vectordbkwargs = {"search_distance": 0.9}
```


```python
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history, "vectordbkwargs": vectordbkwargs})
```

## ConversationalRetrievalChain with `map_reduce`
We can also use different types of combine document chains with the ConversationalRetrievalChain chain.


```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
from langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.prompts import CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
question_generator = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT)
doc_chain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")

chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain(
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    question_generator=question_generator,
    combine_docs_chain=doc_chain,
)
```


```python
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = chain({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
result['answer']
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, from a family of public school educators and police officers, a consensus builder, and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."

## ConversationalRetrievalChain 与带有来源的问答

您还可以将此链与带有来源的问答链一起使用。


```python
from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
question_generator = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT)
doc_chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")

chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain(
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    question_generator=question_generator,
    combine_docs_chain=doc_chain,
)
```


```python
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = chain({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
result['answer']
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, from a family of public school educators and police officers, a consensus builder, and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \nSOURCES: ../../state_of_the_union.txt"

## ConversationalRetrievalChain 与流式传输至 `stdout`

在此示例中，链的输出将逐个令牌流式传输到 `stdout`。


```python
from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.prompts import CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT, QA_PROMPT
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain

# Construct a ConversationalRetrievalChain with a streaming llm for combine docs
# and a separate, non-streaming llm for question generation
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
streaming_llm = OpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)

question_generator = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT)
doc_chain = load_qa_chain(streaming_llm, chain_type="stuff", prompt=QA_PROMPT)

qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain(
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), combine_docs_chain=doc_chain, question_generator=question_generator)

## get_chat_history 函数

您还可以指定一个 `get_chat_history` 函数，用于格式化聊天历史字符串。


```python
def get_chat_history(inputs) -> str:
    res = []
    for human, ai in inputs:
        res.append(f"Human:{human}\nAI:{ai}")
    return "\n".join(res)
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), get_chat_history=get_chat_history)
```


```python
chat_history = []
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"question": query, "chat_history": chat_history})
```


```python
result['answer']
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">
