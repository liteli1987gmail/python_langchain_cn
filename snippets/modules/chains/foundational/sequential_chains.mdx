## 顺序链（Sequential Chain）

当然，并不是所有的顺序链都像将单个字符串作为参数传递并在链中的所有步骤中获得单个字符串的输出那样简单。在下一个示例中，我们将尝试使用涉及多个输入和多个最终输出的更复杂的链。

特别重要的是如何命名输入/输出变量名。在上面的示例中，我们不需要考虑这个问题，因为我们只是将一个链的输出直接作为下一个链的输入传递，但在这里，我们必须关注这个问题，因为我们有多个输入。


```python
# This is an LLMChain to write a synopsis given a title of a play and the era it is set in.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a playwright. Given the title of play and the era it is set in, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.

Title: {title}
Era: {era}
Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["title", 'era'], template=template)
synopsis_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key="synopsis")
```


```python
# This is an LLMChain to write a review of a play given a synopsis.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a play critic from the New York Times. Given the synopsis of play, it is your job to write a review for that play.

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["synopsis"], template=template)
review_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key="review")
```


```python
# This is the overall chain where we run these two chains in sequence.
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
overall_chain = SequentialChain(
    chains=[synopsis_chain, review_chain],
    input_variables=["era", "title"],
    # Here we return multiple variables
    output_variables=["synopsis", "review"],
    verbose=True)
```


```python

### 顺序链中的记忆（Memory in Sequential Chains）

有时，您可能希望在链的每个步骤或链的后面的某个部分传递一些上下文，但是维护和链接输入/输出变量可能会很快变得混乱。使用`SimpleMemory`是一种方便的方法来管理这个上下文并简化您的链。

例如，使用前面的playwright顺序链，假设您想要包含有关剧本的日期、时间和位置的某些上下文，并使用生成的简介和评论创建一些社交媒体发布文本。您可以将这些新的上下文变量添加为`input_variables`，或者我们可以在链中添加一个`SimpleMemory`来管理这个上下文：




```python
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
from langchain.memory import SimpleMemory

llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a social media manager for a theater company.  Given the title of play, the era it is set in, the date,time and location, the synopsis of the play, and the review of the play, it is your job to write a social media post for that play.

Here is some context about the time and location of the play:
Date and Time: {time}
Location: {location}

Play Synopsis:

Review from a New York Times play critic of the above play:

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["synopsis", "review", "time", "location"], template=template)
social_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key="social_post_text")

    memory=SimpleMemory(memories={"time": "December 25th, 8pm PST", "location": "Theater in the Park"}),
    chains=[synopsis_chain, review_chain, social_chain],
    input_variables=["era", "title"],
    # Here we return multiple variables
    output_variables=["social_post_text"],
    verbose=True)
