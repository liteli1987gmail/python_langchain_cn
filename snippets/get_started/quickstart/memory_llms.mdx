```python
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)

conversation.run("Hi there!")
```

这是在引擎盖下面发生的事情

```pycon
> Entering new chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:

> Finished chain.

>> 'Hello! How are you today?'
```

现在，如果我们再次运行这个链

```python
conversation.run("I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")
```

我们会看到传递给模型的完整提示包含了我们第一次交互的输入和输出，以及我们最新的输入
