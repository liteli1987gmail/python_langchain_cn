```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import (
    AIMessage,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage
)

chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
chat.predict_messages([HumanMessage(content="Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.")])
# >> AIMessage(content="J'aime programmer.", additional_kwargs={})
```

It is useful to understand how chat models are different from a normal LLM, but it can often be handy to just be able to treat them the same.
LangChain makes that easy by also exposing an interface through which you can interact with a chat model as you would a normal LLM.
You can access this through the `predict` interface.

```python
chat.predict("Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.")
# >> J'aime programmer
```
