// LangChain wants to make developing and deploying safe, high-quality
// language model applications as easy as possible.
// To manage the complexity and challenges of working with LLMs,
// LangChain provides tracing and evaluation functionality.
// This notebook demonstrates how to run Chains,
// which are language model functions on traced datasets.
// Some common use cases for this approach include:
//    - Running an evaluation chain to grade previous runs.
//    - Comparing different chains, LLMs, and agents on traced datasets.
//    - Executing a stochastic chain multiple times over a dataset to generate metrics before deployment.
// Please note that this example assumes you have LangChain+ tracing running in the background.
// It is configured to work only with the V2 endpoints.
